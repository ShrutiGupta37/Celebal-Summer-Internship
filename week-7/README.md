# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Web App

This project demonstrates a complete **Machine Learning workflow**:  
from data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, to deploying a real-time prediction **web app using Streamlit**.

The goal is to predict whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster based on features like **Passenger Class**, **Sex**, **Age**, and **Fare**.
